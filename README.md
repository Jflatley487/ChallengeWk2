Challenge Project Week 2


Description:

For this challenge, we were given HTML and CSS that needed to be modified in order to become more accessible. When cod makes excessive use of <div>, the code is not easily translated by screen readers. Screen readers make use HTML tags to convey the content and regions of the page, and what elements are available for the user to select. In addition, the CSS was very redundant and many of the element stylings could be consolidated into single declaration block due to identical properties. 

In this challenge, I learned the importance of semantic html for accesibility via screen readers and how to efficiently write CSS.
